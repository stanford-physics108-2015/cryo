abstract = "An adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) is described which was designed for use in the multiband imaging photometer for the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF). This refrigerator was required to cool bolometric detectors for infrared and millimetre waves to 0.1 K. A paramagnetic salt pill with a number of novel features was developed to meet the stringent requirements for an \{ADR\} used in space. An unusual paramagnetic salt, chromic caesium alum (CCA), is used to meet the requirement of thermal stability under the bake-out temperatures used in commissioning space cryogenic vacuum systems. The cycle time for the refrigerator has been reduced to ≈30 min by attention to thermal time constants and by growing the \{CCA\} salt directly on to an array of gold wires. Crystal growing procedures were developed to overcome problems with the low solubility of \{CCA\} in water. The salt pill is sealed in stainless steel to retain water of hydration and is constructed of materials which are not corroded by commonly used paramagnetic salts. "

The paper covers methods of salt pill suspension, magnet technology, lead design, heat switches and temperature readouts, as well as considerations for space qualification. Performance specifications are given for an \{ADR\} which was originally developed for cooling infrared detectors on the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF). This \{ADR\} is presently used on the balloon-borne Millimeter Wave Anisotropy Experiment (MAX) for measuring anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background. Comparisons are made with other \{ADRs\} under development for use in space or on rockets. "

We discuss the design of a leak-tight housing for the salt as well as a technique for growing ferric ammonium alum crystals that results in a housing filled with &gt;98% refrigerant. These techniques have proven to be reliable in creating robust single-stage refrigerators. Similar techniques can be used for the second stage of a dual-stage adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator.
